Program to skip keylogger infecting your computer.
The program just keep the position where you are writing and replace the 
letters with a homemade custom crypt function.
Writing in the field in the browser the program will conver your chars 
in the crypted ones.
----------------       HOW IT WORKS  ------------
1) Open the console of the browser
2) and paste the code as it is.
3) Press enter.
4) If a warning message comes from the browser to prevent javascript 
directly pasted follow the instructions.

---- attention hardware work need to be made --------

write all (or how many you find good for the infection level) keys and 
watch the encryption that the program produces, write somehow (paper 
and pen) the encrypted letters coming out from the encryption on the 
keyboard button that generates that key..

Once your keyboard is inserting in the system other letters the system 
will not get your key as you want, but just as it is, and in the browser 
you can copy paste the code in the console keeping the letter in mind 
and the crypter will convert the chars for you..
In that way pressing submit the browser will get your text but the 
system will output the key pressed, that in this way it does not mean 
anything..
